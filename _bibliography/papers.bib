  abstract    = {This article proposes an optimization framework, based on Genetic Algorithms (GA), to calibrate the constitutive law of von Wolffersdorff. This constitutive law is known as Sand Hypoplasticity (SH), and allows for robust and accurate modeling of the soil behavior but requires a complex calibration involving eight parameters. The proposed optimization can automatically fit these parameters from the results of an oedometric and a triaxial drained compression test, by combining the GA with a numerical solver that integrates the SH in the test conditions. By repeating the same calibration several times, the stochastic nature of the optimizer enables the uncertainty quantification of the calibration parameters and allows studying their relative importance on the model prediction. After validating the numerical solver on the ExCaliber-Laboratory software from the SoilModels' website, the GA calibration is tested on a synthetic dataset to analyze the convergence and the statistics of the results. In particular, a correlation analysis reveals that two couples of the eight model parameters are strongly correlated. Finally, the calibration procedure is tested on the results from von Wolffersdorff, 1996, and Herle & Gudehus, 1999, on the Hochstetten sand. The model parameters identified by the Genetic Algorithm optimization improves the matching with the experimental data and hence lead to a better calibration.},

  year        = {2020},
  abstract    = {The jet wiping process is a cost-effective coating technique that uses impinging gas jets to control the thickness of a liquid layer dragged along a moving strip. This process is fundamental in various coating industries (mainly in hot-dip galvanizing) and is characterized by an unstable interaction between the gas jet and the liquid film. This interaction is of significant interest to industry and academia alike and results in wavy final coating films. To understand the dynamics of the wave formation, this work investigates the response of the liquid film to a prescribed set of disturbances in the impinging gas jet flow. In particular, we extend classic laminar boundary layer models for falling films to the jet wiping configuration, including the self-similar integral boundary layer (IBL) and the weighted integral boundary layer (WIBL) models. Moreover, we propose a transition and turbulence model (TTBL) to explore modeling extensions to larger Reynolds numbers and to analyze the impact of the modeling strategy on the liquid film response. These models were validated on a simple test case using Volume of Fluid simulations and are used to study the response of the liquid coat to harmonic and non-harmonic oscillations and pulsations in the impinging jet. The impact on these disturbances on the average coating thickness and wave amplitude is analyzed, and the range of frequencies yielding maximum disturbance amplification is presented.},

This article presents an open software package, named MODULO (MODal mULtiscale pOd), to perform the Multiscale Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (mPOD) of numerical and experimental data. This novel decomposition combines Multi-resolution Analysis (MRA) and standard Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) to allow for the optimal compromise between decomposition convergence and spectral purity of its modes. The software is equipped with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and enriched by numerous examples and video tutorials (see Youtube channel MODULO mPOD).},
