Hello! I am Miguel Alfonso Mendez and  I am an Assistant Professor
 at the [von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics (VKI)](https://www.vki.ac.be/). Here I teach differential
 equations for fluid mechanics, signal processing, and experimental methods
 at the [Research Master program](https://www.vki.ac.be/index.php/research-master-in-fluid-dynamics) (Master after Master) in fluid dynamics. My research interest 
 includes engineering modeling of fluid flows, experimental fluid mechanics,
 data-driven modal analysis, flow control, inverse problems, and machine 
 learning.

Currently, I am supervising several Ph.D. theses in these fields and I am developing 
two courses courses dedicated to machine learning for fluid mechanics. 
This website collects some material about my courses, upcoming events, ongoing projects, and publications.
